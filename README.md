MTTextStyle
===========

Easy application of centralized text styles to text UI element like UILabel, UITextView, UITextField, UIButton and even drawing context.

Respects user settings of font size and updates live if user changes preferred font size.

Locate text throughout the appliation that hasn't been centralized by setting decentralizedStyledTextLocator to YES. Text that hasn't been centralized will not be affected, while centralized text will turn green and use Chalkduster font.
